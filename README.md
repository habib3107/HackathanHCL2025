Hackathon Banking System API
  
A robust, scalable backend API for a modern banking system built during a hackathon. This FastAPI-based application manages user authentication, customer onboarding, KYC verification, account operations (deposits/withdrawals), and loan processing with EMI calculations. It emphasizes security (JWT auth, password hashing), role-based access control (RBAC), and file handling for documents.
Designed for high performance and ease of use, it supports real-time operations with a MySQL database and includes CORS for frontend integration (e.g., React/Vue on port 3000).
üöÄ Features

User Authentication & Management:

Secure login/logout with JWT tokens (short/long-lived based on "remember me").
Role-based signup (Customer, Admin, Auditor, Superadmin).
Superadmin-only: Create/update/delete users, view all users.


Customer Onboarding:

Create customers with profile/signature uploads.
Validate emails/phones, generate unique customer codes (e.g., CUST0001).
Role-restricted: Customers can only manage their own profiles.


KYC Verification:

Upload identity documents (Aadhaar, Passport, PAN, etc.).
Admin/Auditor: View KYC details, approve/reject with timestamps.
File serving for secure document access.


Account Management:

Create savings/current/FD accounts with initial deposits (min. thresholds).
Deposit/withdrawal with secret code verification.
Transaction history and balance inquiries.


Loan Processing:

Apply for loans with supporting docs and auto-EMI calculation.
Admin review: Approve/reject with reasons/notes.
View personal/all loans (role-based).


Security & Utilities:

Password hashing (bcrypt), JWT with expiration.
File uploads to uploads/ directory with timestamps.
Unique ID generation for users/customers/loans.
CORS enabled for local dev (localhost:3000).



üõ† Tech Stack

Framework: FastAPI (async, auto-docs via Swagger/OpenAPI)
Database: SQLAlchemy ORM + MySQL (or SQLite for testing)
Auth: JWT (PyJWT), Passlib (bcrypt)
Validation: Pydantic, custom regex for emails/phones
File Handling: Multipart uploads with FastAPI's UploadFile
Other: Python 3.12, Uvicorn (ASGI server), Dotenv (env vars), Enum for types

üì¶ Installation


Clone the Repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/hackathon-banking-api.git
cd hackathon-banking-api


Create Virtual Environment:
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt  # Create this file with: fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, pymysql, python-jose[cryptography], passlib[bcrypt], python-multipart, python-dotenv, pytz
Note: Add a requirements.txt file to your repo for easy setup.


Database Setup:

Install MySQL 8.0+ and create the database:
sqlCREATE DATABASE hackathon_db;

Run migrations (automatic on startup via Base.metadata.create_all).
Initial superadmin user (SRU0001) is auto-created on first run.

üîí Security Notes

JWT Tokens: Expire in 3 hours (default); extendable to 30 days.
RBAC: Enforced via get_current_user dependency.
File Uploads: Sanitized filenames, stored in uploads/ (add to .gitignore).
Validation: Email/phone regex, min deposit checks, doc requirements for KYC/loans.
Potential Improvements: Add rate limiting (SlowAPI), email notifications (via SMTP), Redis for token blacklisting.
